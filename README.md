# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

Just me, learning about Machines Learning as machines learn about me.

## This Repo

(April 5, 2020) If all goes well, there should be a sweet
sweet folder for each module with some nice VCS implemented.

## My goals
* Learn how to create a model from a problem statement
* Write modular code
* Use Git well. I'm talking commits and pushes and pulls.
* Write nice code.
  * Comments
  * Functions
  * Docstrings
  * Tests
  * `Python`

## Course Notes
I'm making a Google Drive folder with notes on the program.
I'll link it here since it has lots of good resources.
